# Downloading SSL certificate details

After an SSL certificate is added to the {{site.data.keyword.slportal_full}}, their details can be downloaded at any time. Downloads can include the certificate, Key or PEM, which includes all available details that are associated with the SSL certificate. SSL certificate details are downloaded securely, so there is no risk that is associated with retrieving the details through this method.

To download details for the SSL certificate, complete the following steps.

1. Access the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal_full}} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/){: new_window} by using your unique credentials.
2. From the **Security** menu, select **SSL > Certificates**.
3. From the **Actions** menu, select the preferred **Download Option** for the certificate. Refer to the following table for more information:<br /> <br /><table border="1"><tr><th>Download Option</th><th>Downloaded Information</th></tr><tr><td>Download certificate</td><td>Downloads only the certificate portion, and does not include the Private Key, Intermediate certificate, certificate Signing Request or Notes details.</td></tr><tr><td>Download Key</td><td>Downloads only the Private Key, and does not include the certificate, Intermediate certificate, certificate Signing Request or Notes details.</td></tr><tr><td>Download PEM</td><td>Downloads all details that are associated with the SSL certificate, including the certificate, Private Key, Intermediate certificate, certificate Signing Request and Notes.</td></tr></table>

## Next Steps

After requesting the SSL certificate details for download, they are automatically downloaded in the web browser. Select the download to open the file. The file can also be saved to your workstation for future reference; however, data for any SSL certificate present on the SSL certificates screen can be downloaded automatically at any time by repeating the previous steps.
