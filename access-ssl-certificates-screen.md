# Accessing SSL certificates

## Overview

Within the {{site.data.keyword.slportal_full}}, you can manage and track [SSL certificates ](what-ssl-certificate.html){:new_window} that have been ordered from both {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} and other third party companies. SSL certificates are required to enable features on some products, most popularly the [Load Balancers](../load-balancing/load-balancing.html){:new_window}, and their data must be stored within the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}} to enable those features. All interactions with SSL certificates, including importing, editing and exporting, are performed on the SSL certificates screen within the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}}. Complete the following steps to access the SSL certificates screen.

## Accessing the SSL certificates screen

1. Access the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal_full}} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/){: new_window} by using your unique credentials.
2. From the **Security** menu, select **SSL > Certificates**.

## Next Steps

After accessing the SSL certificates screen, you can  [update](view-and-update-ssl-certificate.html), [download](download-ssl-certificate-details.html) or [delete](delete-ssl-certificate.html), or [import](import-ssl-certificate.html) existing SSL certificates into the tool.
