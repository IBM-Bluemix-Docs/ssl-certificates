# Accessing SSL certificates
{: #accessing-ssl-certificates}

Within the {{site.data.keyword.slportal_full}}, you can manage and track SSL certificates that have been ordered from both {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} and other third party companies. SSL certificates are required to enable features on some products, most popularly the [Load Balancers](/docs/infrastructure/local-load-balancer?topic=local-load-balancer-getting-started-with-local-load-balancer), and their data must be stored within the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}} to enable those features. All interactions with SSL certificates, including importing, editing and exporting, are performed on the SSL certificates screen within the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}}. Complete the following steps to access the SSL certificates screen.

## Accessing the SSL certificates screen

1. Access the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal_full}} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/){: new_window} by using your unique credentials.
2. From the **Security** menu, select **SSL > Certificates**.

## Next Steps

After accessing the SSL certificates screen, you can  [update](/docs/infrastructure/ssl-certificates?topic=ssl-certificates-viewing-and-updating-ssl-certificates), [download](/docs/infrastructure/ssl-certificates?topic=ssl-certificates-downloading-ssl-certificate-details) or [delete](/docs/infrastructure/ssl-certificates?topic=ssl-certificates-deleting-ssl-certificates), or [import](/docs/infrastructure/ssl-certificates?topic=ssl-certificates-importing-ssl-certificates) existing SSL certificates into the tool.
